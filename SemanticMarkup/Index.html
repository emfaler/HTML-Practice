When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do
<!-- description -->
At least, not anymore...

<!-- title for next item -->
Want bold text?
<!-- make 'right way' bold first the wrong way, then the right way -->
There's a wrong way and a right way. Always use the right way!

<!-- title for next item -->
Maybe you need some italics?
<!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
Again, it used to be done like this. This is wrong. This is the right way.

Separation of concerns
<!-- description -->
The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content. It should not be used to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!

Links
<!-- make either 'place' in the next body of text a link to your favorite site. (keep it appropriate) -->
Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from place to place on the internet.

Sections
<!-- go back through and group each section correctly
     stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use div's for this
